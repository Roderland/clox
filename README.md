# clox

My implementation of the compiler & bytecode VM for Lox language.

This branch contains code for chapters in part-III of the book [《crafting interpreters》](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/a-bytecode-virtual-machine.html).

:eyes: There are more features in [branch master](https://github.com/Roderland/clox/tree/master) such as 'break & continue', 'plus-assign', 'list'.
